# SubSimGPT2
### Software-in-the-loop Submarine Simulator for Michigan Robotic Submarine

Receives control data from the sub code, simulates the vehicle's dynnamics, then sends back simulated sensor data and camera feeds.

Used at competition in 2025 to test and develop strategies when water testing time was not available.

May be moved to the mrobosub organization in the near future.
